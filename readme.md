This project is a refactoring of the old GBAATM (last release around 2011) with the original source code as starting point (got from Cracker, the original author).  
The purpose is a new UI, multiplatform support and maybe new features with code refactoring and optimization.  
The original source code is available at [this page](https://github.com/Mte90/GBAATM-Rebirth/releases/tag/original).  
Any help is important to improve the code and document what is doing.
